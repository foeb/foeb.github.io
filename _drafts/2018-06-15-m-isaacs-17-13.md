**Problem** *(I. M. Isaacs, 17.13)***.**
*Let $$F$$ have prime characteristic $$p$$ and let $$E=F(Y,Z)$$, where $$Y$$ and $$Z$$ are indeterminates. Let $$L=F(Y^p,Z^p)\subseteq E$$.*

*a. Show that $$\alpha^p\in L$$ for all $$\alpha\in E$$.*

*b. Show that $$E\neq L[\alpha]$$ for any $$\alpha\in E$$.*

Part (a) is essentially asking us to prove that the *Frobenius endomorphism* that maps $$\alpha\mapsto\alpha^p$$ is an endomorphism in the base field $$F$$.

**Solution.**
First, let $$f\in F[Y,Z]$$. Then,

$$
f(Y,Z)=\sum_{i+j=0}^m a_{ij}Y^iZ^j
$$

for some $$a_{ij}\in F$$.
Since $$p$$ divides

$$
\binom{p}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}=\frac{p!}{k_1!k_2!\cdots k_m!}
$$

as long as $$1\leq k_i\leq p-1$$ for $$i=1,\ldots,m$$, the multinomial theorem tells us

$$
f^p=\left(\sum_{i+j=0}^m a_{ij}Y^iZ^j\right)^p
=\sum_{i+j=0}^m (a_{ij}Y^{i}Z^{j})^p
=\sum_{i+j=0}^m a_{ij}^pY^{pi}Z^{pj}\in F[Y^p,Z^p].
$$

Now let $$\alpha=f/g\in E=F(Y,Z)$$, where $$f,g\in F[Y,Z]$$ and $$g\neq 0$$. By the reasoning above, $$f^p$$ and $$g^p$$ are both in $$F[Y^p,Z^p]$$, so

$$
\alpha^p=(f/g)^p=f^p/g^p\in L=F(Y^p,Z^p),
$$

which proves (a).

To show (b), we will construct an infinite number of intermediate fields between $$E$$ and $$L$$ and apply the following theorem from the text:

**Theorem** *(Artin)***.** *Let $$F\subseteq E$$ be a finite field extension. Then $$E=F[\alpha]$$ for some element $$\alpha\in E$$ if and only if there are just finitely many fields $$K$$ with $$F\subseteq K\subseteq E$$.*

This is reasonable since $$E$$ is a finite field extension of $$L$$ (since $$E=L(X,Y)$$ and $$X$$, $$Y$$ are both algebraic over $$L$$). Let $$p_1<p_2<\ldots$$ be primes each not equal to $$p$$, and define $$f_i(Y,Z)=Y^{p_i}Z^{p_i}$$. Then, $$f_i\in E$$ but $$K_i=L(f_i)\supsetneq L$$ since $$p^i$$ is not divisible by $$p$$. Therefore, we have an infinitely many intermediate subfields $$K_1,K_2,\ldots$$ and by the theorem, $$E\neq L[\alpha]$$ for any $$\alpha\in E$$. âˆŽ
